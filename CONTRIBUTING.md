## âš¡ How We Worked

1. **Planning & Vision**
   - Conducted initial brainstorming sessions to define the project scope and goals.  
   - Designed a **modular architecture** separating LLM, backend, and frontend.  
   - Defined clear **roles and responsibilities** for each team member.  

2. **Collaboration & Workflow**
   - Used **GitHub for version control**, creating feature branches for all tasks.  
   - Conducted **daily or frequent sync-ups** to coordinate work and resolve blockers.  
   - Shared **design mockups, diagrams, and code snippets** via GitHub issues and discussions.  

3. **Development**
   - **Backend:** Built APIs, implemented automation, added data extraction and error handling.  
   - **Frontend:** Created UI components, integrated APIs, and designed responsive layout.  
   - **LLM Integration:** Configured the local LLaMA model, created prompt templates, and tested outputs.  

4. **Testing & Review**
   - Conducted **unit and integration testing** for backend and LLM functionality.  
   - Performed **UI testing** to ensure correct data display and interactivity.  
   - Code reviews were performed via **GitHub Pull Requests** for quality assurance.  

5. **Documentation & Presentation**
   - Maintained **README.md** with workflow, tech stack, and team contributions.  
   - Created **diagrams, YAML snippets, and demo outputs** to visualize the system.  
   - Added **CONTRIBUTING.md** to explain the teamâ€™s workflow and responsibilities.
